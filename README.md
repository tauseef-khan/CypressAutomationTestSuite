# CypressAutomationTestSuite
Hello company I applied for/recruiter who wants someone with Cypress experience,

This repo is for me to show you that I am learning and practising Cypress so I can land a job with your company/client. I'm hoping that along with my 6+ years of experience in QA. This repo might convince you to hire me even though I lack commercial experience in Cypress. I need to start somewhere and this is the place for it.

I'm developing tests against an e-commerce website which I deployed myself using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)...welcome to [Dino's Donuts](https://dinosdonuts.vercel.app/). I used a website template from [Astro's website](https://astro.build/themes/details/dounut/) to get started quick.

Have a look around and hopefully you like what you see here and decide to hire me!

Your future colleague,

Tauseef
